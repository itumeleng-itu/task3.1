                <p>
                    <b>Networking</b> and wireless connections are crucial for devices to communicate and share resources.
                    it involves connecting devices for data and resource sharing.<br>
                    Key aspects include:<br>
                    Network Topologies: How devices are arranged (e.g., Star, Bus).
                    <br>Network Devices: Hardware like Routers, Switches, Modems, and Network Interface Cards (NICs) that enable connectivity.
                    <br>Network Protocols: Rules for data transmission (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).
                    <br>Types of Networks: Differentiated by size and scope (e.g., LAN for small areas, WAN for large areas like the internet).
                    <br>Wireless Connections allow communication without cables, using technologies like:
                    <br>Wi-Fi: The most common wireless LAN technology, based on 802.11 standards (e.g., Wi-Fi 6 for faster speeds).
                    <br>Bluetooth: Short-range for personal devices.<br>

                <h2>Functionality of server networks</h2>
                <p>
                    Server networks provide centralized services, resources, and management to client devices. Their main functions include:
                    Serving Client Requests: Responding to requests for web pages, emails, applications, etc.
                    Data Storage & Management: Storing and managing large amounts of data (files, databases) centrally.
                    Resource Sharing: Managing shared resources like printers and automatically assigning IP addresses (DHCP).
                    Network Management & Control: Directing network traffic and handling user authentication/authorization (DNS).
                    Security & Data Protection: Implementing firewalls, encryption, access controls, and backups to protect data and resources.
